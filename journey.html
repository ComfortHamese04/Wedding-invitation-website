                    To say that you will find love when you least expect it would, to some, sound cliché. Especially with both Lance and I being avid travelers, always on the move. However, our paths seemingly crossed when least of us would expect us, showing that you truly never know when love is just around the corner.
                    <br>This will take as all the way back to 2014, when our paths crossed on vacation. We were on the beaches of Phi Phi Island in Thailand, both with our respective friends. Myself and my best friend at the time had booked a tour on one of the long tail boats to go swim with the sharks, as well as visit Maya beach. (The one where they filmed for James Bond). Being such a small boat and being in such a great mood because of being on holiday, you naturally become friendlier to the people around you. Everyone was chatting and getting to know one another. To be fair, Lance was not someone that caught my eye immediately. I could tell that he was very shy and kept to himself, however, the tour guide was very good at getting everyone to interact with each other. Now, I am not sure if he saw myself and my friend (being both girls) and thought it would be fun to partner us up with the two single men, but this is what came to be. (They ask you to dive in pairs of two, just so that everyone has someone looking out for them) This is where Lance and I had our first interactions. I immediately noticed how witty and caring he was and always making sure I was ok, and would help me and my friend get on and off of the boats. We had an absolutely fantastic day on this tour. The best part is that when you get back to the island, you still have plenty more to do. We hit it off straight away and both had 5 days remaining on the islands. Let’s just say that memories were made.

                    However, in the back of your mind you know the inevitable is about to happen. You both need to go home.
                    This is where it gets weird, as if the universe does align for certain events in your life. 
                    Both of us were heading to new jobs at the same school in Uzbekistan. What are the chances? Nobody has even heard of the place. 
                    I am a teacher at the international school there and he works in the IT field.
                    Since then, we have been blessed to become so close and in love. Our travels 
                    have taken us around the world, allowing us to experience all these different cultures together. Getting married only solidifies 
                    this bond between us. The life that we have lived up until this point has been so exciting that I can’t even fathom what the next 
                    chapters of our lives hold for us, together.
