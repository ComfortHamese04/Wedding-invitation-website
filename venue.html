            for up to eighty guests. This impressive semi-permanent space offers unsurpassed sea views with its open marquee that invites 
            salty sea breezes and glorious sunsets to spill directly into the main seating area. The all-white, neutral palette venue requires 
            very little additional decor, allowing brides to put their unique stamp on it to reflect their own personality and taste. On trend 
            with the best weddings in the world, exciting options include details such as ‘smoked sorbet service’ for the bridal couple who would 
            like to surprise their guests with an even more exciting dining experience.
